An example of the AngularJS CRUD
============

It's an example of single page application, that was created with AngularJS. It implements all main goals of CRUD. Application is working with REST API.

To run it you just need to change <code>apiUrl</code> in the file <i>/js/services/productsServices.js</i>. <code>apiUrl</code> is the url of your REST API.

In application we use one custom directive. It's checking whether the field is a unique product name.
